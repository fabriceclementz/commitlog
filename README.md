# Commit Log

> WIP

A commit log implemented for learning purpose after reading [Design Data Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net).

I'm using [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org) to encode log messages.

Logs are at the heart of many tools like databases or data streaming platforms so I think it's beneficial to learn how it works.

This project is used for that and I also take the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of [Rust](rustlang).

Some interesting lectures about logs:
